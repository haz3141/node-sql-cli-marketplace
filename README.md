# node-sql-cli-marketplace
An Amazon-like CLI marketplace built using Node and MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, the program will track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Problem & Solution

The goal here is to create a CLI application that takes in a command and a query. The command tells the app what kind of item and how many of that item the user would like to purchase.
